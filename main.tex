\vspace{\topsep} % Hacky fix for awkward extra vertical space
\begin{tightemize}
\item Designed a customer-facing system that supports data labelling for ML scientists to train and develop their AI models, collaborated with 4 different engineering teams to implement. The system supports end-to-end flow from requesting labelling to delivery of quality labelled data.  (Java, Python, React, AWS services like EC2 / Lambda / SQS / DDB etc)
\item Designed microservice-based backend architecture to enable secure access to Alexa's data from the internal data warehouse tool protecting customer privacy, this architecture was mandated in all the services across org's engineering teams (Java, Javascript, AWS - API Gateway / EC2 / Lambda / SQS / DDB)
\item Designed and implemented a common UI framework for integrating custom plugins to the UI platforms, which indeed was used by 3 engineering teams to efficiently manage the ownership of UI components in a single web application (React, HTML, CSS)
\item Designed and developed a feature within the data labelling system to support photo/video data labelling for specific ML scientists requiring quality labelled data for customer visual data such as photos and videos. (Java, React)
\item Designed and developed a feature within the data labelling system to support photo/video data labelling that helped developed ML models on visual data. (Java, React)
\item Collaborated with AWS organisation to evolve the AWS service offerings for ML scientists internally as well as externally by designing a vast range of data labelling features and improving the ML model execution service.
% \item Collectively working with the AWS team to evolve the AWS offerings for internal and external customers by designing and implementing core platform features for ML scientists (Java, Javascript, React, AWS)
\item Mastered software engineer using Agile methodology by participating in product backlog grooming, sprint planning, review and retrospective
\item Volunteered as a mentor for new software engineers in their transition to the team/firm \& help develop their professional career
